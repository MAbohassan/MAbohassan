### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mohamed Abohassan.

Iâ€™m a back-end engineer at Aqarmap, 
Also currently Iâ€™m responsible for the DevOps part to support our running apps.

I have been working as a software engineer for almost 5 years now,
 using multitude of technologies like PHP, Javascript, Nodejs, VueJs, 
but in recent 2 years I focused myself in backend development especially using PHP.

I feel quite comfortable with different databases like Mysql, Redis, Elasticsearch, and MongoDB

I have a good knowledge over clouded prospects as well such as Docker, kubernetes, and helm.
